## Summary
This solution demonstrates the implementation of a 4-switch buck-boost converter using average current mode control on the Four-Switch Buck-Boost Development Board (4SWBB).
This power board is a generic development board for this topology that supports rapid prototyping and code development based on dsPIC33 devices. The board provides organized building blocks that include an input filter, power stage, AUX supply, mating socket for Microchip’s newest Digital Power
Plug-In Modules (DP-PIMs), Human Machine Interface (HMI) and test points. The
electrical characteristics are applicable to automotive requirements and can be used for these applications as well. For example, input power can be a standard 12V vehicle power rail and operate within the automotive ambient temperature range. A mating socket for dsPIC33 Plug-In Modules allows the system to be evaluated with different controllers. The pin-out is compatible for EP, CK and CH dsPIC® DSC DP PIMs.

The associated firmware uses average current mode control to regulate the output voltage. The input voltage range is 8V to 18V, and the output voltage range is 5V to 20V. It can run without external cooling up to 20W and 2A at the output.

The firmware also includes a scheduler to allow the user to easily add their own housekeeping functions. In our example code, the scheduler executes drivers for the Human Machine Interface (HMI) and for communication with the Board Power Visualizer GUI.

## Phase Current Balancing

A current balancing scheme has been implemented on the demo firmware accompanying this board. The goal is that both phases share the load current equally. This scheme is only run if the total load current is above 1.4A (see the macro "IOUT_SRONIL" in the firmware), so the thermal stress is shared equally between the phases when the load is high enough that thermal management is warranted.

The scheme works by changing the duty cycle of the SR drive signals on one phase until the currents are approximately the same, while keeping the duty cycle of the SR drives on the other phase fixed. When the scheme is launched, the (filtered) currents of both phases are compared. The phase with the smaller current runs at a fixed (just under 50%) duty cycle, while the duty cycle of the SRs on the phase with the larger current is varied between a min value (100ns) and a max value (just under 50%) until the two currents are as close as possible.

Decreasing the duty cycle of the SR drives on a phase will decrease the amount of current flowing through this phase and increase the amount of current flowing through the other phase. The total output current remains the same.

<span id="state-machine"><a name="state-machine"> </a></span>

### State machine


<p>
  <center>
    <img src="images/illc-01.png" alt="ILLC current balancing state machine" width="500">
    <br>
    Current balancing state machine
  </center>
</p>
The state machine that runs the current balancing algorithm is illustrated above. It is run in the ADCAN0 interrupt, which is executed every 6th PWM period. 

<br/>
<br/>

<span id="standby-state"><a name="standby-state"> </a></span>

#### STANDBY state
Both SRs are disabled, so any conduction is through the body diodes of the SRs. We stay in this state until the output voltage is above 6V (see macro "VOUT_SR_ACTIVE") and the total output current is above 1.4A (see macro "IOUT_SRONIL"). If both of these conditions are satisfied we go to the enable state. 

<p>

    <img src="images/illc-02.png" alt="standby-state-flowchart" width="450">
    <br>
    Flowchart for STANDBY state
  </center>
</p>

<br/>
<span id="enable-state"><a name="enable-state"> </a></span>

#### ENABLE state

Both SRs are still disabled. The two phase currents are compared. In our current balancing algorithm, the phase with the smaller current has a fixed SR duty cycle, and the SR duty of the other phase is varied to get the currents in balance. So the decision on which phase to fix and which to vary is made once at this point, and remains in force while the algorithm is active.

Note that the phase current measurements used for the comparison are filtered to reduce the effect of noise on the decision.


<p>
  <center>
    <img src="images/illc-03.png" alt="enable-state-flowchart" width="400">
    <br>
    Flowchart for ENABLE state
  </center>
</p>

After the comparison is made, PWM2 and PWM4 (the PWMs used to drive the SRs for phase A and phase B respectively) are enabled and set at min duty cycle. The PWM setup is actually done in the STANDBY state, but the PWM outputs from the dsPIC are not enabled until the ENABLE state.

<p>
  <center>
    <img src="images/illc-04.png" alt="pwm2-setup" width="800">
    <br>
    PWM 2 setup
  </center>
</p>

As discussed in section XXX, the PWMs are configured in "Independent, dual output" mode. To recap, PG2 is used to drive the SRs for phase A, and PG4 is used to drive the SRs for phase B. 

For phase A, the rising edge of PWM2H is set via the PG2TRIGA register (so the event is triggered when the internal period counter in PG2 reaches PG2TRIGA), and the falling edge set via PG2TRIGB. The rising edge of PWM2L is set by the PG2PHASE register, and the falling edge via the PG2DC register. 

For phase B SR drive, PG4 is used, so PG4TRIGA, PG4TRIGB, PG4PHASE and PG4DC are used to set the rising and falling edges on PG4H and PG4L in the same way as for PG2. 

<br/>
<span id="softstart-state"><a name="softstart-state"> </a></span>

#### SOFTSTART state

In this state, the duty cycles of the SR drives on both PG2 and PG4 are linearly ramped from the min duty (100ns pulse width) to the max duty (PGxPER/2*250ps - 124ns) in steps of 10ns.

<p>
  <center>
    <img src="images/illc-05.png" alt="enable-state-flowchart" width="800">
    <br>
    PWM 2 setup
  </center>
</p>

The falling edges of the PWM2 and PWM4 outputs are fixed during the ramping of the duty cycle, and the rising edges are moved.
For PG2, PG2TRIGB is fixed at 50ns before the end of period, and PG2DC fixed at 50ns before the end of the half-period. For PG4, PG4TRIGB is fixed at 50ns before the end of period, and PG4DC fixed at 50ns before the half-period.  

During the soft-start ramp, PG2TRIGA, PG2PHASE, PG4TRIGA and PG4PHASE are decreased by steps equivalent to 10ns so that the duty cycle increases by 10ns each time.

The ramp is stopped when the rising edge of PG2PHASE is 74ns from the start of the period. Thus at the end of the ramp, all SR drive signals are running at just under 50% duty cycle (precisely, this is [PG2PER/2*250ps] - 124ns).

At the end of the ramp, we change to the UP AND RUNNING state.

<br/>
<span id="up-and-running-state"><a name="up-and-running-state"> </a></span>

#### UP AND RUNNING state

<p>
  <center>
    <img src="images/illc-06.png" alt="up-and-running-state-flowchart" width="1000">
    <br>
    Flowchart illustrating the UP AND RUNNING state
  </center>
</p>

In this state, one of the SR drives of either phase A or phase B runs at a fixed duty cycle, and the other is moved. The decision on which phase to fix and which to vary is made in the ENABLE state and doesn't change thereafter. 

If the output current through the phase being controlled is greater than the current through the other (fixed duty) phase, we decrease the duty cycle of the SR drives by 2ns. If the current is smaller, we increase the duty cycle on the SR drives by 2ns. The on-time of the SR drives is clamped at a max value of [PGxPER/2*250ps - 124ns], and at a min value of 100ns.


If the total output current drops below 1.0A (see macro "IOUT_SROFFIL"), all SR drives are disabled, and we go back to the STANDBY state.

## Quick-start Guide
In this section, we describe step by step how to run the firmware on the power board. We also describe how to interface with the board power visualizer GUI.
<br/>


<span id="basic-hardware-setup"><a name="basic-hardware-setup"> </a></span>

### Basic Hardware Setup 

Connect the DP-PIM to the power board. Then connect the ICD4 debugger to the 6-pin header on the DP-PIM via the RJ11 cable and the RJ11 to ICSP adapter. Finally, connect a USB cable between the micro-USB port on the top-right of the DP-PIM and your computer - for this you will require a type A to micro-USB type B cable.
<p>
  <center>
    <img src="images/4SWBB-basic-setup-00.png" alt="EPC9531 Test Fixture Connections - Top View" width="700">
    <br>
    Connections from DP-PIM and power board to computer
  </center>
</p>

The firmware provides the capability for a potentiometer to provide the output voltage reference. We recommend using the facility the first time you bring up the board.
The potentiometer needs to be connected to the 6-pin header on the edge of the power board, as shown below.
<p>
  <center>
    <img src="images/4SWBB-basic-setup-01.png" alt="EPC9531 Test Fixture Connections - Top View" width="700">
    <br>
    Connecting a potentiometer to the power board, to provide the voltage set-point
  </center>
</p>
There is an 8:1 resistive divider on the power board between the converter output terminals and the dsPIC pin at which the output voltage is sensed at. Hence, if the potentiometer is used to provide the voltage loop reference, in closed loop operation the output voltage = (Voltage at pin 2 of header) * 8.

At start-up, the firmware detects if a potentiometer is present, and if so, uses the voltage on pin 2 of the header as the reference for the voltage loop compensator. If no potentiometer is sensed, then the default set-point is fixed to get 12V at the output terminals.

For first board bring up, set the potentiometer wiper to get the lowest possible voltage on pin 2 of the header.

Next, connect a voltage source to the input terminals and a load to the output terminals as shown below. For first board bring-up, set Vin=12V and use a resistive load of approximately 30R. The output voltage can be probed at test point TP340, which is located at the top right of the board. Once the converter is up and running, you can change these values.

    <br>
    Connecting a source and a load to the power board
  </center>
</p>
Next, follow the instructions in the user’s guide to program the dsPIC via MPLABx.


At this point, the code should be running on the dsPIC without any input voltage or load. You should now check the status LEDs on the power board and DP-PIM (for more information on the status LEDs, please refer to the user’s guide).

### Setting up and connecting the board power visualizer  

<br/>

Open board power visualizer on your computer. On the window that appears, click "Open Project", and then navigate to the "gui" folder (the "gui" folder is at the same level as this README.md file). Select "4SWBB", and the window below will open.
<p>

    <br>
    Board power visualizer window for 4SWBB
  </center>
</p>

More information about the items in the status window is shown below. On the left are the "signal" channels, to the right there are buttons and a slider to control the output voltage reference source and value. On the right, the controller state, fault flags and status flags are shown.
<p>
  <center>

    <br>
    Board power visualizer status window
  </center>
</p>
There are a number of other tabs on the top of the screen, you can click on these to find out more, they are pretty self-explanatory hence we don't go into much detail on tabs in this document.
<p>
  <center>

    <br>
    Board power visualizer tabs
  </center>
</p>
<br/>
Now you need to pair the GUI with the firmware running on the dsPIC.
To do this, click on the "COM?" button, select the port and speed (the speed should default to the correct value of 115200), then click on the "Enable" button.
<br/>
<br/>
If the communications channel is working, you should see the "Communications status" button on the bottom left of the status window flashing alternately green and red. The status window should show around 12V on Vdd, the converter state should be "standby" and the "Open loop" flag should be asserted. The "AVG current Mode" flag should also be asserted, indicating that this firmware uses average current mode control.
<p>
  <center>
    <img src="images/4SWBB-basic-setup-08.png" alt="EPC9531 Test Fixture Connections - Top View" width="700">
    <br>
    GUI status window at start-up
  </center>
</p>

To start running the converter, short press the "USER" button on the power board.
<p>
  <center>
    <img src="images/4SWBB-basic-setup-09.png" alt="EPC9531 Test Fixture Connections - Top View" width="700">
    <br>
    Starting the converter
  </center>
</p>
The converter is now running "open loop". This means that the duty cycle is set directly based on the potentiometer voltage. The voltage loop compensator output is ignored in open loop mode. 

<br/>

At this point 

* The green LED on the power board should be permanently on.
* The Red LED on the power board should be slow blinking.

Going back to the GUI screen, you should see the following: 
<p>

<span id="running-closed-loop-with-poti-reference"><a name="running-closed-loop-with-poti-reference"> </a></span>

 ### Running Closed Loop with Poti Reference


* Short press the "USER" button on the power board.
    * This turns off the converter.
    * "Ctrl-State" on the GUI should be "Standby".
* Long press the "USER" button: this changes to "closed loop" mode.
    * Poti voltage provides reference to voltage loop compensator.
    * Voltage loop compensator provides reference to current loop compensator.
    * Current loop Compensator drives the duty cycle.
* Set potentiometer wiper to get minimum voltage on pin 2 of 6 pin header.

<p>

  </center>
</p>

* Short press the "USER" button on the power board.
    * This turns on the converter.
    * "Ctrl-State" on the GUI should be "Running".

<p>
  <center>
    <img src="images/4SWBB-basic-setup-12.png" alt="EPC9531 Test Fixture Connections - Top View" width="150">

    GUI status window with converter running in closed loop mode
  </center>
</p>

* Observe the LEDs on the power board.
    * Green LED should be permanently on.
    * Red LED should be off.

The converter is now running in closed loop mode. This means that the potentiometer output is providing the reference to the compensator, and the output of the compensator drives the duty cycle.

Move the potentiometer wiper to change the voltage loop reference and thus the output voltage. 

[[back to top](#start-doc)]

<span id="running-closed-loop-with-a-fixed-reference"><a name="running-closed-loop-with-a-fixed-reference"> </a></span>

### Running Closed Loop with a Fixed Reference
To run the firmware with a fixed internal reference, disconnect the potentiometer from the power board and re-start the firmware. At start-up, the firmware checks for the presence of the potentiometer. If the firmware determines that no potentiometer is connected, it used a fixed internal reference that corresponds to an output voltage of 12V. In this case, you will see that the "Fixed Ref" flag will be on.
<p>
<center>
  <img src="images/4SWBB-basic-setup-13.png" alt="EPC9531 Test Fixture Connections - Top View" width="150">
  <br>
  Fixed Ref flag in GUI status window
</center>
</p>

To run closed-loop with a fixed reference:
* Long press "USER" button to change from open loop mode to closed loop mode.
* Short press "USER" button to run converter.

At this point, there should be 12V at the output. You can short-press the "USER" button to turn on/off the converter.  <br/>
[[back to top](#start-doc)]

<span id="running-closed-loop-with-gui-reference"><a name="running-closed-loop-with-gui-reference"> </a></span>

### Running Closed Loop with GUI Reference


Configure the converter to run in closed loop mode. To use the GUI programmable reference, either click on the "Update Ref value" button on the GUI or click on the "Update" button on the slider. You can select the output voltage using the slider. The "GUI Ref" flag should be on when the GUI reference is active.

  </center>
</p>

At this point, you can try different combinations of input voltages, output voltages and loads. Note that the converter can operate safely to a max output power of 20W, and max output load current of 2A.

## Control Method

This version of the 4-switch buck-boost firmware uses Average Current Mode Control (ACMC). 

In Average Current Mode Control the current reference (Iref) is generated by the outer voltage loop is set to be equal to the inductor current average. 
The "error" of the inner current loop passed through a 2 pole 2 zero (2P2Z) digital compensator. The output of the compensator is an integer that is proportional to the duty cycle, and this drives the pulse width modulator (PWM). 

Essentially, the outer voltage loop sets the demand for the inner current loop so as to ensure that the charge removed from the output of the converter by the load is replenished at the same rate, so as the output voltage of the converter remains constant.

    <br>
    Average Current Mode Control
  </center>
</p>

Note that the input current, which is sensed by the current transformer, is used as an input to the inner current loop.

<span id="loop-measurements"><a name="loop-measurements"> </a></span>

### Loop Measurements

The frequency response of the (inner) current loop is shown below. The output current is limited to 2A in the firmware. For this measurement, the load is increased until the current limit is reached and Vout drops below 20V, this way the voltage loop is saturated and the current loop is in control.

### Start-up
* The PWM is initialized
  * the PWM outputs are disabled but the PWM modules are running internally to trigger the ADC ISR.
  * This is important as all signal measurements are based upon the ADC ISR.

<span id="fault-handler"><a name="fault-handler"> </a></span>

### Fault Handler

* The fault handler is called every 100us, just before the state machine is executed. 

<span id="state-1-initialization"><a name="state-1-initialization"> </a></span>

### State 1: Initialization

* The fault counters for Vin under-voltage and over-voltage are set. 
* Done here to enable Vin faults when auxiliary power is driven via USB connected to the DP-PIM.

<span id="state-2-fault-active"><a name="state-2-fault-active"> </a></span>

### State 2: Fault Active
* Stays here until all fault conditions are cleared.

<span id="state-3-standby"><a name="state-3-standby"> </a></span>

### State 3: Standby
* PWM is active, and the control mode (open loop or closed loop) is saved. 
* Force switch to open loop mode
  * means that current loop compensator does not drive the duty cycle.
  * instead, the voltage loop demand directly drives the duty cycle. 
  * At this point, the voltage loop demand is set to 0, which corresponds to minimum duty cycle.

<span id="state-4-soft-start-in-open-loop"><a name="state-4-soft-start-in-open-loop"> </a></span>

### State 4: Soft-start in Open Loop
* Voltage loop demand, and hence Duty cycle, is increased linearly until Vout >= 3V.  
* The saved control mode (open or closed loop) from state 3 is then restored. 
* Voltage compensator initialized with pre-loaded value for controller output.
  * Ensures a smooth start to the soft-start ramp. 

<span id="state-5-soft-start-closed-loop"><a name="state-5-soft-start-closed-loop"> </a></span>

### State 5: Soft-start (closed loop) 
* Voltage loop reference ramped linearly to give a fixed soft-start time under all conditions.

<span id="state-6-up-and-running"><a name="state-6-up-and-running"> </a></span>

### State 6: Up and Running
* Converter is running, and conditions based on flags are checked. 
* Faults and HMI inputs can cause state change, depending on converter status.

### More Details on Start-up
Additional information on the start-up characteristic is shown below.

    Start-up characteristic
  </center>
</p> 
We start off in open loop mode with minimum duty cycle: this means that the duty cycle is directly proportional to the voltage loop reference (the current loop compensator output is ignored). The voltage loop reference, and hence duty cycle, is slowly increased until the output voltage reaches 3V. When Vout >= 3V, the duty cycle is saved and used as the new buck minimum duty cycle. The converter then switches to closed loop mode and the voltage loop reference is ramped linearly until it hits its target value.

## Plant Frequency Response Simulation with MPLAB® Mindi™
Mindi™ is the Microchip-branded demo version of Simplis/SiMetrix. It supports the common features of the Simplis standard license but limits the number of circuit nodes. 
A model of the 4SWBB plant is available with this deployment.
To open the file in Mindi, select File -> Open, and navigate to 4swbb_01_using_generic_PWM_with_ACanalysis.wxsch.

    Plant model in Simplis
  </center>
</p> 
The model is setup to simulate the frequency response of the plant at a particular DC operating point. 

The output of the PWM generation blocks on the bottom of the Mindi file generate a steady-state duty cycle (controlled by the DC source V4) superimposed with a small amount of AC jitter (controlled by the AC source V2). During the frequency response analysis, the frequency of the AC source V2 is swept from 100Hz to 200kHz. 

By default, the input voltage is set to 8V and the duty is set to get an output voltage of 20V. R10 (the load resistor) is set to 20R so as the output power is 20W. These values can be changed to simulate the response at different operating points.

The POP (Periodic Operating Point) trigger is required to tell the simulator when each switching cycle starts, hence it needs to be placed on an appropriate node - here it is placed on the buck switching node.

The bode plot probes measure the gain and phase of the plant frequency response, both for the current and voltage.

To check the simulator settings, select Simulator -> Choose Analysis.

To run the simulation, select Simulator -> Run Schematic.

### A note on DC gain of the Plant Measurement with Mindi

This Mindi schematic has been setup so as the simulated and measured plant gain have the same magnitude.

The plant DC gain of buck and boost converters in CCM is given by the following equations:

<p>
  <center>
    <img src="images/4SWBB-basic-setup-27.png" alt="EPC9531 Test Fixture Connections - Top View" width="400">
    <br>
    DC gain of buck and boost in CCM 
  </center>
</p> 

The response to a disturbance is measured from the plant input - which is the modulator input VCTRL in our Mindi schematic, to the output terminals of the converter. The DC gain as defined in the equations at the start of this section is the magnitude of the disturbance as measured at the plant output divided by the magnitude of the disturbance as measured at the modulator input, at frequencies just above DC.

Vramp is defined as the peak to peak voltage of the sawtooth ramp in the modulator.

The two complementary PWM blocks on the bottom of the schematic generate the PWM switching signals. Internally, they use a sawtooth ramp to generate the PWM signals.

    <br>
    Buck PWM generator block settings 
  </center>
</p> 
Above we show the settings for the Complementary PWM block for the two buck switches. The ramp starts at 0V and ends at 0.5V, hence Vramp = 0.5V.

For the PWM generator for the boost switches, we show the settings below. The ramp start voltage = 0.5V, and stop voltage = 1V, hence Vramp = 0.5V, like for the buck converter.

    Boost PWM generator block settings

</p> 

We set the ramp magnitudes so as Mindi plant simulation matches the real plant measurements. If the open loop demand is less than 50%, the buck leg is active (duty changes with demand) and the boost leg runs at minimum duty cycle. For open loop demands greater than 50%, the buck leg runs at maximum duty and the boost leg is active. 

So in our Mindi schematic, if V4 < 0.5V: the buck leg is active and the boost runs at min duty, and if V4 > 0.5V: the boost leg is active and the buck leg runs at max duty.

Because Vramp = 0.5V, the DC gains as given by the equations at the start of this section will be a factor of 2 greater than they will be in the measured result (as Vramp is in the denominator of the DC gain calculation for both the buck and the boost equations). This is why the output of the AC probe on the top right of our Mindi schematic is tied to the VOUT_ node and not directly to the converter output terminals (that is, the VOUT node). The VOUT_ node is the output voltage divided by 2. Thus, the gain of the plant measurements and Mindi simulations match pretty accurately.

## Importing Plant Frequency Response into DCDT

The Digital Compensator Design Tool (DCDT) helps power supply designers by simplifying the overall process of determining the digital compensator coefficients and analyzing the control system performance. The DCDT incorporates all feedback gains and delays to provide the most accurate model of the control system. 
Measurements of the plant frequency response can be imported into DCDT to help with the process of compensator design. 

As an example, we have included a such a plant measurement taken using this development board, at Vin = 8V and Vout = 20V. The data needs to be in a .csv file. This file can be found in the directory "plant" and is called "BodePlant Vin 8V Vout 20V 20W.csv".

To import this data into DCDT, open MPLABx, then click Tools -> Embedded -> Digital Compensator Design Tool.

In the window that appears, select "Single-Loop: vmc" and then click "Open".
